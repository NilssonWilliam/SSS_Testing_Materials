# Performance tests

This folder contains the code required to run the performance related tests. 

## Single path

The single path tests are the tests that test the performance in the case where there is a direct link or tests are ran on a single device. The goal with these tests is to estimate the overhead the secret sharing scheme imposes by itself. 

## Multi path

The multi path tests are the tests that test the performance overhead introduced by having multiple paths to a receiver.
